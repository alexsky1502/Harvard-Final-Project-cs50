            <h3> What is Visual Impairment?</h3>
            <p>
                Is a term experts use to describe any kind of vision loss, whether it's someone who cannot see at 
                all or someone who has partial vision loss. Some people are completely blind, but many others have 
                what's called legal blindness.
