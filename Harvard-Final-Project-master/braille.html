            <h3> What is Braille?</h3>
            <p>
                Braille is a system of raised dots that can be read with the fingers by people who are blind or 
                who have low vision. Teachers, parents, and others who are not visually impaired ordinarily read 
                braille with their eyes. Braille is not a language. Rather, it is a code by which many 
                languages—such as English, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, and dozens of others—may be written and read. 
                Braille is used by thousands of people all over the world in their native languages, and provides 
                a means of literacy for all.
            </p>

            <p>
                The specific code used in the United States has been English Braille, American Edition but as of 
                2016 the main code for reading material is Unified English Braille, a code used in seven other 
                English-speaking countries.

            <h3> Braille alphabet and numbers </h3>
            <p>Braille symbols are formed within units of space known as braille cells. A full braille cell 
                consists of six raised dots arranged in two parallel rows each having three dots. The dot positions 
                are identified by numbers from one through six. Sixty-four combinations are possible using one or 
                more of these six dots. A single cell can be used to represent an alphabet letter, number, 
                punctuation mark, or even a whole word. This braille alphabet and numbers page illustrates what a 
                cell looks like and how each dot is numbered.</p>

            <h3> How was Braille Invented? </h3>
            <p> Louis Braille was born in Coupvray, France, on January 4, 1809. He attended the National Institute 
                for Blind Youth in Paris, France, as a student. At that time, books were created using raised print 
                which was laborious to produce, hard to read, and difficult for individuals to write. While 
                attending the Institute, Braille yearned for more books to read. He experimented with ways to create
                an alphabet that was easy to read with the fingertips. The writing system he invented, at age fifteen,
                evolved from the tactile "Ecriture Nocturne" (night writing) code invented by Charles Barbier for 
                sending military messages that could be read on the battlefield at night, without light. </p>
