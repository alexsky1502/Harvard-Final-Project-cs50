## Welcome to Alex's CS50 Final Project - "Visually Impaired"

### To begin with my project is about Visually Impaired people, and my focus is to inform more about them and the language that they use in their daily lives.



    As soon as you open the website, Index.html is the homepage where you will find information about Visually Impaired people, what pages the website have and which languages that it was used.
    Index.css has a section about the menu, the initial image that appears in the background, the font-size of the text, the footer and tha last the scroll: when the user scroll the mouse it shows the next section in the webpage. This scroll is made by javascrip adding a function.

    In the top part of the website, you’ll be able to select the different sections you want to open. Next to the “Home” button you will find “Braille”. Braille.html is the page that informs about the alphabet that  visually impaired people actually use.
    Braille.css has an initial image that appears in the background, and afterwards it also has a questions and answers section. In this section we are going to figure out about what braille is and how it was invented. There is also an image that shows the machine that is used to write in the Braille code system and the alphabet it self, that also shows how to write numbers.

    Exs.html is the next page you’ll be able to open. That’s where you can practice all the things you have learned in the previous page about Braille.
    The exs.css has a warning that says "The braille alphabet within a physical world is represented by bulky marbles. Although the exercises are online, where you cannot touch, our site is only intended to inform you how actually it works!".
    Exs.html has a simple javascrip that take the input of the user and validate if it is right or wrong. When the user input is wrong, the background color of the section turns into red, when it is correct, it turns into green and when it is almost right it turns into yellow.

    Contato.html is the last page of the website, where the user is able to send me a message in case there are any doubts, points i should improve or to give me an opinion.
    There are also some images that as soon as user clicks it, they are sent to my instagram and facebook pages. Also, there is my friend´s social network, due to her help in making the video and correcting the english texts that were written in the website. She is very good when it comes to the English language :)

    With that being said, this is my final project, I hope you guys have enjoyed it and this is cs50x!
